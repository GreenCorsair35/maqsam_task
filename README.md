# maqsam_task
This repository contain a script (executable) that selects a desktop wallpaper from a given set of images.
The selected wallpaper should approximately represent the location of the sun at the time of execution, based on the given geographical location.

## Usage:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python wallpaper.py <latitude> <longitude>

## Note:
please keep retrying if you get error related to the API, because the free open API that I found (timeapi io) fails sometimes.
